# Kurosaki-C2
This project is created for me to learn how to create a Python-based C2. I came across the [Building a Basic C2](https://0xrick.github.io/misc/c2/#Payloads-Generator) blog created by @0xrick. I heavily referenced his C2 design and code to build this C2, so all credit should belong to him. However, I will attempt to add additional features into this project for my learning purposes.  

## Features

## Implants
* C++ Windows Executable (Created by @0xrick)


## ToDo
- [ ] SSL Communication
- [ ] JScript implant implementation


## Change Log / Fix
* 10/03/21 - Initial commit for the project
